The BIRT Viewer that come with Eclipse BIRT Viewer has a basic appearance. This appearance makes BIRT Viewer not too friendly for some users. Other things that motivate me to develop this project is because BIRT Viewer has a limitation to show datetime parameter field.
ExtJS as one of well known AJAX framework today has many high performance customizable UI widgets. It has well designed and extensible component model. Thats why I choose this framework to create new BIRT Viewer appearance.
